`TheCatInTheHat.txt`: **The Cat in the Hat** was written by Dr. Seuss
(Theodor Geisel).

The files `FiveLittlePeppers.txt` and `IndianFairyTales.txt` were
downloaded from Project Gutenberg. I use part of the first chapter ("A
Home View") in *Five Little Peppers* by Margaret Sidney (Harriett
Lothrop) and the Indian fairy tale *The Talkative Tortoise*
(`Talkative.txt`) as tests for the scripts we develop.

Please note that I removed: some double quotes from `HomeView.txt` to
make sure double quotes only surround dialogue; and some whitespace
indentation from `Talkative.txt` to simplify the event conditions in
the scripts we develop.

`emptyLines.txt` can be used as a test file for Homework #3.
