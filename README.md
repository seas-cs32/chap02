This directory contains everything needed for
**Chapter 2 (Grab the Dialogue)** in
[*Computational Thinking and Problem Solving (CTPS)*](https://profsmith89.github.io/ctps/ctps.html)
by Michael D. Smith.

`read32.py`: our complete solution to the problem in Chapter 1 (i.e.,
it reads a children's story).  This script is a renamed copy of
`chap01/ale03c.py`.

`script1.py`: the parts of `read32.py` that we can use as a start
to solving the new problem in Chapter 2 (i.e., turn a story into
a theatrical script).

`script2.py` - `script7.py`: incomplete scripts that track the major
steps we follow in Chapter 2.

`script8.py`: a script that we hope will work for dialogue spread
over two or more file lines. We're not sure it will work for other
patterns of dialogue.

`script9.py`: a script that fixes a problem with `script8.py`, which
didn't work for dialogue contained completely within one file line.

`txts`: Directory containing plaintext stories (i.e., `[title].txt`).
The chapter and its exercises make reference to a number of these
files as test inputs.

`count32.py`: starting point for ALEs 2.1-2.5.

`script32.py`: a cleaned-up version of `script9.py` that serves
as the starting point for ALE 2.7.

`ale08.py`: starting point for ALE 2.8.
