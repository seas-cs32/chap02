This directory contains everything needed for
Chapter 2 (i.e., Problem 2 in Act I, Scene I (Scripts)).

**Files for STUDENTS**

`read32.py`: our complete solution to the problem in Chapter 1 (i.e.,
it reads a children's story).  This script is a renamed copy of
`chap01/ale03c.py`.

`script1.py`: the parts of `read32.py` that we can use as a start
to solving the new problem in Chapter 2 (i.e., turn a story into
a theatrical script).

`script2.py`: an incomplete script, in which we have started to fill
in the code for state `S0` (and nothing for state `S1`).

`script3.py`: a script that we hope will work for dialogue spread
over two or more file lines. We're not sure it will work for other
patterns of dialogue.

`script4.py`: a script that fixes a problem with `script3.py`, which
didn't work for dialogue contained completely within one file line.

`txts`: Directory containing plaintext stories (i.e., `[title].txt`).
See the assignments and exercises make reference to a number of these
files as test inputs.

`count32.py`: starting point for Homework #3.

`script32.py`: a cleaned-up version of `script4.py` that serves as
the starting point for pset #2.

`pset2.md`: The description of the programming assignment for this
chapter. In CS32, this file becomes `instructions.md` in the `pset2`
Replit project.
